# gsk-slack

**PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gsk-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, and security rules.

> **Note:** a unified `gsk connector` flow is rolling out (see `../gsk-connector/SKILL.md`: `gsk connector tools <id>` / `gsk connector call <id> -t <tool>`) and may not be enabled for every account yet. THIS command remains fully supported — use it directly, and it stays the fallback whenever `gsk connector` is unavailable.

Slack messaging operations. Actions: send, search, search_files, read, download_file, lookup, react, upload, update, delete, permalink.

## Usage

```bash
gsk slack [options]
```

Confirmation-gated: on a CLI with client-side confirmation the command runs as a single call after the [y/N] prompt (or --yes).; 'invite': Invite workspace members into a channel.

| `--message` | No | [send] The message content to send. Supports Slack markdown formatting. To @mention someone, embed '<@USER_ID>' (e.g. '<@U01234567>') in the text — a plain '@Name' renders as literal text and notifies nobody. User IDs come from the lookup action. 'content' is accepted as an alias for this parameter. (string) |
| `--recipient` | No | [send] Optional recipient: 'self' (default), channel ID (e.g., 'C01234567'), or user ID (e.g., 'U01234567'). If not specified, sends to yourself. (string) |

| `--query` | No | [search] The search query. You can use modifiers like 'in:#channel', 'from:@user', 'has:link', 'before:yyyy-mm-dd'. \| [search_files] Search terms; Slack modifiers such as 'in:#channel', 'from:@user', 'before:yyyy-mm-dd' are honored. (string) |
| `--count` | No | [search] The maximum number of messages to return. Default is 100. \| [search_files] Maximum files to return (default 20, max 100). (integer) |

IDs come from the lookup action. \| [react] Conversation ID containing the message (channel 'C…', private group 'G…', or DM 'D…'). \| [invite] Conversation ID of the channel to invite into (public 'C…' or private group 'G…'). \| [upload] Target conversation ID (channel 'C…', private group 'G…', or DM 'D…') the file is shared into. \| [update] Conversation ID containing the message (channel 'C…', private group 'G…', or DM 'D…'). \| [delete] Conversation ID containing the message (channel 'C…', private group 'G…', or DM 'D…'). \| [permalink] Conversation ID containing the message (channel 'C…', private group 'G…', or DM 'D…'). (string) |

| `--cursor` | No | [read] Pagination cursor from a previous call's next_cursor to fetch older messages. (string) |
| `--file_id` | No | [download_file] Slack file id (starts with 'F'), from a message's files list (read action) or a search_files hit. (string) |
| `--lookup_type` | No | [lookup] What to look up: 'users' for team members, 'channels' for channels/conversations, 'all' for both. (string, one of: users, channels, all) |
| `--search_query` | No | [lookup] Optional search query to filter results by name. Case-insensitive partial match on name, display name, or real name. (string) |

## Write Confirmation

Confirmation-gated actions: `send`, `react`, `invite`, `upload`, `update`, `delete`. The CLI shows a preview and asks `[y/N]` on stderr before the single server call; pass `--yes` (`-y`) for unattended runs. `--no-input` (or `--args-file -`, which consumes stdin) makes a gated call exit 2 with no server call instead of hanging. Never re-run a command to 'confirm' it — every call is a real execution. `--skip_confirmation true` / `--auto_skip_confirmation` are deprecated on this CLI (still accepted, warn on stderr): use `--yes`.

Interactive-only actions: `send`, `react`, `invite`, `upload` (the action excludes the skip params, e.g. Marketplace policy on Slack) — `--yes` is ignored and a real `[y/N]` answer is required.
